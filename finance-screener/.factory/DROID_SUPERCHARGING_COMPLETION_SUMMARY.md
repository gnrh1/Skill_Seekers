## 🧠 Mental Model Application

### Mental Model Coverage

| Model                    | Applied To                                              | Result                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First Principles**     | Orchestrator, SQL Specialist, Data Integrity, TDD       | Each droid has clear, irreducible mission                   |
| **Second Order Effects** | Cost Tracker, Precision Validator, Regression Detector  | Budget explosion, precision loss, silent failures prevented |

| **Inversion**            | Rate Limit Guardian, Failure Detector, Edge Case Hunter | IP bans, data corruption, edge cases anticipated            |
| **Interdependencies**    | All specialists coordinate through orchestrator         | Tight couplings identified and managed                      |

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Option C File-Based Architecture

**Why Option C?**

- ✅ Eliminates JSON Task response size limits (unknown, typically 25-50 KB)
- ✅ Prevents silent truncation mid-JSON
- ✅ Guarantees complete data transfer (file system, not API)
- ✅ Enables atomic writes (no partial data)
- ✅ Provides audit trail (all artifacts searchable)

**Implementation:**

- All 16 droids write to `.factory/memory/{droid-name}-{ISO8601-timestamp}.json`
- All droids return minimal Task response: `{status, artifact_path, summary}`
- Orchestrator reads artifact files directly (bypasses Task response limits)
- Zero truncation risk verified in strategy document

### Specialist Routing

**16 Specialist Droids Organized By Role:**

| Role                     | Count | Examples                      | Purpose             |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Core Specialists**     | 3     | SQL, Answer Gen, Orchestrator | Primary query paths |
| **Existing Specialists** | 3     | TDD, Ingestion, RAG           | Proven capabilities |
| **Guard Specialists**    | 5     | Cost, Rate Limit, Precision   | Prevent disasters   |
| **System Specialists**   | 2     | Sync, Graceful Degradation    | Resilience          |
| **Monitoring**           | 1     | Pipeline Monitor              | Observability       |
| **Audit**                | 1     | Data Integrity                | Quality assurance   |

### Orchestration Patterns

✅ **Pattern 1:** SQL queries (structured) → financial-data-sql-specialist → answer generation  
✅ **Pattern 2:** Semantic queries (conceptual) → hybrid-rag-query-architect → answer generation  
✅ **Pattern 3:** Fallback (primary fails) → graceful-degradation-handler → alternative path  
✅ **Pattern 4:** Guard specialists always run in parallel for cost, health, regression tracking

## 🎓 Key Insights & Design Decisions

### Why 16 Droids?

**First Principles Analysis:**

- 1 droid per irreducible mission component
- Too few → Droids overloaded, lose specialization
- Too many → Management overhead
- 16 = optimal balance (core + guards + system + monitoring)

### Why Option C Architecture?

**Second Order Effects Analysis:**

- Task response limits → truncation → silent failures → lost user trust
- File-based → Guaranteed complete data → trustworthy results
- Overhead of writing files << risk of truncation

### Why Master Orchestrator?

**Systems Thinking Analysis:**

- 16 independent droids need coordinator
- Orchestrator as nervous system: routes signals, synthesizes responses
- Central point for mental model application (right droid for right query)

### Why Mental Models in Every Droid?

**First Principles Analysis:**

- Each mental model prevents specific class of failures
- Documenting which model applies → clarity of thought
- Cross-droid consistency → system coherence
